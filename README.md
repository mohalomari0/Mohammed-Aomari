# This TensorFlow Lite model can perform classification of ECG images and is able to distinguish between a group of heart diseases that can be detected from an ECG image.
# The classes are: 
#                  1- V-Atrial flutter 
#                  2- Q-VT 
#                  3- N-Ventricular_Hypertrophy 
#                  4- M-Pac
#                  5- F-Sinus Bradycardia 
#                  6- COVID_19 
#                  7- Normal
